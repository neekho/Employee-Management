hey chatgpt. i want to create an employee "account"
in my system, i have a User and Employee models.

User.js
const userDocument = new mongoose.Schema({

    email: {
        type: String,
        required: [true, "email is required"]
    },

    password: {
        type: String,
        required: [true, "password is required"]
    },


});

Employee.js

const employeeDocument = new mongoose.Schema({

    firstName: {
        type: String,
        required: [true, "first name is required"]
    },

    user: { 
        type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, 
        ref: userDocument
    
    }


})

the user key will associate the User information. How can i make a route that will make the process like appear that the registration process is only one step?







My model is set up like this: 
User.js, and Employee.js  In the Employee schema, the user is being passed by an object ObjectId

now i have a controller:

module.exports.employees = (req, res) => {

    Employee.find({active: true})
    .then(result => res.send(result))
    .catch(error => res.send(error))

};

How can i also get the Employees, email and password and role?
